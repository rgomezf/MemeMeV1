# MemeMe 1.0: Meme Editor

The Meme Editor View consists of an image view overlaid by two text fields,
one near the top and one near the bottom of the image.

In the Meme Editor View, when the user clicks on the “Album” button, an Image Picker
is presented, making it possible to choose an image from the Photo Album.
If a camera is not available on the device, the camera button is disabled.

To share the image press the button on the top left corner of the screen and the Activity
view screen will appear.  After an option is chosen the Activity View
screen is dismissed and the Meme Editor is visible again.
